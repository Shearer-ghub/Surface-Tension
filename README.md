# Surface-Tension
Surface Tension calculations of Deionized water over varying temperatures, salt, and soap solutions

In this experiment the determination of surface tension of water deionised in
varying temperatures, saline and detergent solutions were carried out. The
surface tension of deionized water at room temperature was determined to
be 67.08Â± 5.30 mN/M and in agreement of the commonly accepted value of
72mN/m. The surface tension for Deionized water under varying temperatures,
saline and detergent solutions produced some successful individual results in
agreement with N. B. Vargaftik et al and K. G. Nayar et al. However the
Kelvin relation and Gibbs adsorption Isotherm relationships were not found to
be in agreement with the trends of the data in this experiment and are discussed.
